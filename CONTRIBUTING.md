### When contributing to TidesDB a couple things.

- Make sure your code comments are all lower case and in English and using `/* */` style.
- When adding to tidesdb.c or tidesdb.h please make sure you follow prefixing conventions for internal, public methods.
- Use `code_formatter.sh` to format source code before submitting a pull request.
- Assure your changes are tested and pass all tests.
- Make sure your changes are well documented.
